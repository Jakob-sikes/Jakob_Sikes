                This collection of 3D weapon variations was designed for product visualization, focusing on creating a
                futuristic,
                off-world aesthetic that diverges from traditional firearm designs. Modeled and textured in Blender, I
                utilized mirror
                modifiers to refine symmetrical structures and incorporated Bloom effects to enhance the glowing
                elements, adding depth
                and variation. The designs emphasize sleek yet unconventional forms, pushing beyond the orthodox
                silhouettes of modern
                weaponry.

                This 3D jet model, inspired by the X-Wing from Star Wars, was created as a product visualization piece
                to explore
                intricate mechanical design and animation. Modeled and textured in Blender, the project emphasizes both
                aesthetics
                and functionality, featuring animated landing gear retraction and wing separation to highlight its
                complexity.
                A carefully crafted lighting setup and a turntable animation enhance the presentation, creating a
                striking and
                immersive showcase that amplifies the futuristic appeal.

                This 3D model set features two distinct tank variations, differing in weaponry and material design while
                maintaining the recognizable silhouette of a generic tank. Created in Blender for product visualization,
                the models use relatively low-poly construction to optimize performance while retaining visual
                appeal—making
                them versatile for both static renders and real-time applications. Bloom effects and dynamic lighting
                enhance
                the presentation, emphasizing the differences in armament and material. Originally designed as a
                standalone piece, one of the models was later integrated into my interactive comic project,
                demonstrating its adaptability in different media.

                This animation depicts a malfunctioning machine tearing open a portal, pulling nearby boxes into its
                swirling void.
                Shot from a static camera perspective, the scene focuses on the chaos unfolding, with added camera shake
                to intensify
                the severity of the malfunction. Modeled and textured in Blender, I utilized node shaders to create a
                dynamic portal
                illusion, enhanced by keyframed rotations for a mesmerizing spinning effect. To push the animation
                further, I refined
                it in DaVinci Resolve, applying additional effects to heighten the atmosphere and immersion. This
                project was a personal
                exploration of visual storytelling and dynamic motion, blending 3D animation with post-processing for a
                more polished and
                dramatic presentation.

                Created for a two-week game jam hosted by Boise State University's Game Dev and Design club, this
                animation aimed to capture the immersive and foreboding essence of a Souls-like game. Using a
                first-person perspective, the scene follows a lone wanderer navigating a fog-drenched, mysterious town,
                evoking a sense of unease and discovery. Modeled and textured entirely in Blender, I used keyframed
                animations for character movement and environmental interactions, enhancing the realism of the
                experience.

                To refine the presentation, I brought the animation into DaVinci Resolve, where I smoothed transitions,
                adjusted pacing, and applied subtle motion enhancements to deepen the atmospheric tension. The final
                piece balances eerie visuals and fluid movement,
                immersing the audience in a haunting world reminiscent of the Souls-like genre.

                In Spring 2024, our team created an interactive comic exploring the randomness of the universe through
                branching narratives and minigames. The story follows an abstract character from childhood to death,
                with pivotal choices drastically altering their journey. I contributed by modeling and refining scenes
                in Blender, enhancing them in Photoshop, and rendering them in a comic-style format for Unity. I also
                designed a maze minigame, symbolizing a critical decision where players choose between an easy but
                unethical path or a difficult but moral one. A key challenge was maintaining narrative cohesion across
                multiple branches while ensuring engaging gameplay, which we solved through careful story mapping and
                iterative testing. This project blended storytelling, game design, and visual artistry, creating an
                immersive experience that captures life’s unpredictability.

                In Fall 2023, our group developed an augmented reality (AR) game that combined a 2D Unity card game with
                real-world Blender models as AR components. Players used digital cards to summon characters and elements
                that appeared in the real world through AR. My role involved creating all artistic assets, including the
                UI, 3D AR models (such as a farmer, soldier, raven, snake, and food), and 2D card designs. A key
                challenge was ensuring seamless integration between 2D gameplay and AR interactions, which required
                refining textures and optimizing models for performance. Working with AR introduced a new level of
                complexity and immersion, transforming static cards into interactive experiences. This project was a
                valuable exploration of creative asset design and innovative ways to engage players through mixed
                reality.

                In Fall 2023, I developed my first solo game, a 2D soccer-themed platformer that blends my love for
                soccer and game development. Using a pixel art style for its nostalgic charm, I focused on gameplay
                mechanics like double jumps, dashes, and collectible cards for points. Players control a soccer ball,
                dodging defenders and obstacles while aiming for the goal. The biggest challenge was learning to code in
                Unity for the first time, but overcoming it made the experience incredibly rewarding. Designing
                mechanics, balancing difficulty, and seeing the game come to life deepened my appreciation for game
                development. This project reinforced my passion for crafting engaging, interactive experiences and
                taught me valuable skills in both game design and programming.
